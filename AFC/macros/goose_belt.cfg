description: Goose Belt Purger routine. Call with parameter LENGTH or VOLUME to set required purge volume (in mm or mm^3)

# ===Parameters===
#Parametrization is ordered according to phases where each parameter is used. Each phase is described in its function

#############
# General
#############
    # Filament diameter. Used to convert purge volume to purge length 
variable_filament_diameter: 1.75

#############
# Phase 0: Staging
#############
# Toolhead goes to a safe position from which we can reach purging belt
#________________________
    # True if purging shall start by movement to staging point. False if printhead shall go directly to purging position
    # Can be disabled if you are certain you will only ever call purging from already safe spot. This is often case with MMUs, for which you park first anyway to swap a filament
variable_start_with_stage: True
    # where should toolhead go before reaching purge position? Should be safe spot which can be reached without collisions and from which purge position can be reached
variable_x_stage: 15
variable_y_stage: 309
variable_z_stage: False    # set 'False' if you have gantry mounted purger and you do not want any Z axis movement. Set numerical value if you need to move in Z axis, e.g. frame mounting on V2.4
    # what speed should be used to go to staging position before purge (mm/s)
variable_th_to_stage: 300

#############
# Phase 1: Move to purging location
#############
# Toolhead goes to purging position and belt gets activated
#________________________
    # where should toolhead go for actual purging
variable_x_purge: 15
variable_y_purge: 309
variable_z_purge: False    # set 'False' if you have gantry mounted purger and you do not want any Z axis movement. Set numerical value if you need to move in Z axis, e.g. frame mounting on V2.4
    # what speed should be used to go to purge position. Also used for return to stage after purge (mm/s)
variable_th_to_purge: 200
    # speed at which should be belt driven (PWM duty cycle) Should be value between 0.0 and 1.0
variable_belt_pwm: 0.33
    # Fan control:
    # Activating or disabling fan may have beneficial effect on adhesion to belt or to detachement from belt. Purge macro can store your fan setting, override it for duration of purge and automaticaly restore it after
    # This variable controls if fan is controled by macro. False if fan should not be overriden
variable_control_fan: True
    # This sets fan speed during purge routine. Value between 0.0 and 1.0. Beware, if you print materials sensitive to draft, setting your fan too high can have negative influence on printed object
variable_fan_speed: 0.25

#############
# Phase 2a: Purging
#############
# Single purging segment. Followed by Phase 2b: Dwell if full purge volume was not reached, or by Phase 3: After run, if we are done purging
#________________________
    # feedrate for extrusion during purge (mm/s)
variable_extrusion_fr: 5
  # feedrate for retraction (mm/s)
variable_retraction_fr: 30
  # feedrate for de-retraction (mm/s)
variable_deretraction_fr: 30
  # Purging volume is split into several shorter segments to ensure waste material has manageable size. Each segment is folowed by retraction. Macro adjusts actual segment length to waste as little fillament as possible.
    # minimum length of extrusion (mm). 
variable_extrusion_min: 20
    # maximun length of extrusion (mm)
variable_extrusion_max: 50
    # retraction length
variable_retraction: 2
    # Round up last segment? Last segment in purge routine is usually shorter than other segments. It might be good idea to round up last segment length to match others to prevent issues with waste removal. increases waste volume
variable_roundup: True


#############
# Phase 2b: Dwell
#############
# Dwell in between purging segments. Purpose is to create physical separation between purge segments. Is followed by deretraction and always proceeds back to Phase 2a
#________________________
    # dwell time between retraction and deretraction (in milliseconds)
variable_rtr_dwell: 500
    # speed belt should have during dwell. Usually 100% PWM (1.0) to shorten the dwell phase. Set -1 if normal purging speed shall be kept.
variable_belt_pwm_dwell: 1.0
    # this is additional dwell time to allow belt to slow down. Might not be needed if the inertia of the system is low (top belt speed is low), in which case set it to 0. Skipped if you are not changing belt speed during dwell
variable_slowdown_dwell: 0
    # deretraction length
variable_deretraction: 2

#############
# Phase 3: After run
#############
# Finishing steps of macro, such as switchin off motor
#________________________
    # True if purging shall end by movement back to staging point (see Phase 0). False if you want to skip staging and go directly to printing moves
    # Can usualy be disabled, which will save time and reduce oozing
variable_end_with_stage: True
    # Should printer restore Z coordinate after purge? Useful for frame mounted purgers. Changes Z by G1 command directly from staging or purging position.
    # Set false for when Z movement is not needed (e.g. Trident, or gantry mounted V2.4)
variable_restore_z: False
    # what speed should be used to restore Z (mm/s). Ignored if restore_z is set to False
variable_th_z_restore: 10
    # how long after purging routine ends should be belt stopped. Useful to cleanup all the remains on belt (in seconds)
variable_time_belt_stop: 16
    # speed belt should have during ending phase. Usually 100% PWM (1.0) to shorten the cleaning. Set -1 if normal purging speed shall be kept.
variable_belt_pwm_end: 1.0
    # user script to be called at the end of macro. Can be used to initiate for example wiping on brush. Set '' to not call anything
variable_user_end_script: ''
